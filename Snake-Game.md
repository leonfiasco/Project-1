##General Assembly Project 1

## Snake Game

The first project I created, was a retake on the classic mobile game snake.

### Programmes used:
HTML5 + HTML5 AUDIO

SCSS

JAVASCRIPT(ECMASACRIPT 6) + jQuery

GITHUB

##Methodology, Logic, Research and Layout
To build my game I used pseudo code to plan what components my game would need such as, grid, snake and score. I also needed to include the actions the player would need to select to operate the snake which, helped me determine what keys i would used for my game.

#Logic 
The logic for my game was pretty simple, make the snake longer by eating the food ,and in order to stay alive you have to avoid clashing into the four exterior walls and also when long enough clashing into yourself.

#Research
Before building my game, I had to do some research on other games online to get some inspiration. I managed to gather some ideas on what styles I might like to use and other additions I could include to my game to make it unique.

#Layout
Prior to me doing any coding I drew out my preferred layout on a piece of paper ,and added things I would like to include and where they would be positioned. I also wrote down colour schemes.

##Challenges and Lessons
 The first challenge  came across was the type of grid I would use for the game, I thought about using an array but, when looking for instructions on how to build my array on google there was a limited amount of helpful content. I then opted to used HTML canvas as, it was easier for me to create a snake and style also there was plenty of resources on google which helped guide me on building my game.

Second challenged I faced was creating collisions for the snake colliding into its own body ,and for the four parameters of the grid and finally for the food. 

Third challenged I faced was creating the food which would have to random appear in different locations on the screen when eaten and also not to appear on snake.

#Lessons
Going into the project I had apprenhension in my abilities to produce a working game ,and even though im still not that great im still impressed at myself for managing to create something is functional.

* I drastically improved my knowledge in html structure and css styling and partially javascript/jQuery but in time I will get better.

* I hve also learned how to value the process of pseudo coding as this helps to plan whats going into a projects and give you step by step instructions on what to include.

##Unsolved problems and Future Additions

Currently there are a few minor bugs in my game, but the main issue is that the right side of grid has collision issues so once the snake passes the parameter it continues to keep going off the screen.


#Future Additions
The future additions I would like to add the game:

* Adding bonus fruits that give extra points
* Adding different speed levels
* adding a local storage so the highscore can be updated 
* make it functional on mobile and other handheld devices
* possible adding levels with mazes 
* Improve the UI
